- let's forget about the caching first, it can always be added later transparently
- but: we might need to cache the current txn's writes, as the path can only be
  constructed right before the commit.
- could do the latter as a 'global' map in system, saves space, and also is easier
  as one TxnLocal with one particular before-commit hook
