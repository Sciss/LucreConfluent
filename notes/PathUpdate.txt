sys.t { csr.path }

// disadvantage: one may be tempted to call this inside the txn

( first of all, csr.t should check
 require( Txn.findCurrent.isEmpty, "..." )
)

because that way we can guarantee that a successive sys.t can read the new path?

so better: csr.t returns the path and not the result of fun which is anyway a bad idea

////////////////////////////

the main problem now is in HashedTxnStore.put : we call Hashing.add here but key does _not_ contain the write suffix yet. thus we need to maintain another map [Pth, V] so that Hashing.add is actually called in commit
